THEMELIZE.ME: BOOTSTRAPS CSS
--------------------------------

Aim to keep bootstrap code separate and overwrite it with theme-style.less. This makes it easier for customers to update Bootstrap themselves. 
CSS Bootstrap files are the same as downloaded direct from their website but the .less version is included into theme-style.less so it's mixins are available.
Similar is done with Font Awesome.
